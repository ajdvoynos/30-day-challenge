## Final thoughts
**Made it through the 30 days without giving up!** Super hyped that I actually finished all problems in the allotted timeslot. There were definitely some days where I thought I wasn't going to make it. Overall I thought it was a fun challenge, but I don't think I will be attempting it two months in a row. I've read some people saying it was too easy (too many repeated problems) - but that wasn't the case with me at all. Each problem was new for me, and I haven't spent any time working on my algorithm skills since school.

### Week 1 
Started off easy enough. Most problems could be solved in less than an hour. I actually spent more time setting everything up in my local git repo and creating test cases than solving the problem. I think the hardest one this week was maximum subarray. I would definitely not categorize that one as easy.

### Week 2
Still easy enough. Got a few new types of problems with linked lists and binary that forced me to remember how to work with those data structures. I think most of week 1 and week 2 were spent remembering when to use which data structure and how to use it most efficiently. Hardest problem for me was Binary Tree Diameter, mostly because I had to write some helper methods to create a binary tree from an array. I was actually feeling in a row so I even grabbed an extra problem that wasn't part of the challenge!

### Week 3
Things started to get hard. I could no longer solve any problems in less than an hour and I was starting to get burned out from the daily problems. Started to get pathfinding, dynamic programming & tree traversal problems. I think I spent double the time working on problems this week than the last 2 weeks combined. This week was full of hard problems.

### Week4
Got a couple of much appreciated easy problems this week. There were 2 hard ones though that took a toll. Longest common subsequence and maximal square. I spent way too much time working on a dumb approach for maximal square and then the solution just hit me and solved it in 10 minutes. And longest common subsequence was just a painful experience all around.

### Week5
The end is so close but I felt so burned out from the last 2 weeks. Hopefully the 2 binary tree problems were super easy, even though one of them was marked as hard, and I managed to solve both in 15 minutes.
